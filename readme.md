# Guns
## Intro

This is a project that will examine gun deaths in the U.S. from 2012-2014. As usual, the data comes from Kaggle with the specific site located here: https://www.kaggle.com/hakabuk/gun-deaths-in-the-us. I do intend that this project will be somewhat similar to my UFO or murder study project. I may also bring in some new skills that I have learned form a recent data science course that I am taking on Udemy.
